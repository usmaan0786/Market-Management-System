# Market-Management-System
## Description
I have developed a comprehensive market management system using C# and the .NET framework. The system features a user-friendly interface that includes a loading form and a login form, allowing access for two types of users: sellers and administrators. Each user can log in using their unique username and password.

To facilitate efficient management, I have implemented three dedicated forms within the system. The first form enables the management of sellers, providing functionalities for creating, reading, updating, and deleting seller records. This empowers administrators to maintain an organized and up-to-date database of sellers.

The second form focuses on food categories, allowing administrators to oversee and modify different categories associated with food products. The form provides convenient options to perform CRUD operations on food category records, enabling administrators to effectively manage the categories as per their requirements.

Additionally, I have incorporated a fourth form that facilitates the Selling Management. This form enables the addition of new products to the system, allowing sellers to input relevant information such as product details, pricing, and stock levels. Furthermore, the form includes features for generating and printing bill receipts, as well as viewing a comprehensive list of the selling products. This functionality provides sellers with a consolidated overview of their sales and aids in maintaining accurate sales records.

Overall, my market management system streamlines the various aspects of running a market, offering a user-friendly interface for sellers and administrators. With its ability to handle CRUD operations on seller records, food categories, and product management, the system provides a robust solution for efficient market management and enables users to maintain accurate and organized data.
